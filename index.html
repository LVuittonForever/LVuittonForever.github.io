Raised on a farm nestled in the Kettle Moraine Glacier Park in Hartford, Wisconsin, Adam was quickly inspired by the fantastic beauty around him; Clouds in the most unique patterns, hills that stretched the horizon, and monstrous trees that tickled the heavens.</p>      <p>This heritage was vital in shaping his morals and viewpoints, as well as securing his innate connection with the earth around him.</p>      <p>The eldest of five children, Adam learned responsibility at an early age, putting loved ones ahead of him and taking care of his little brothers and sisters. School was rough for him, being unique no one quite understood him. But alone time turned out to be his meal ticket as he threw all of his ambition into breaking out of the small town shackles that were threatening his sanity.</p>      <p>Adam moved to Miami in the fall of 2011, pursuing a degree in biochemistry at the University of Miami. His motivations shifted slightly after his second year and he took an additional major in visual journalism to nurture his creativity and beauty-oriented thought process. This was the perfect fit. After honing his skills with some of the best professors, he began to find his calling.</p>      <p>But how was he going to find a career that merged the two very different schools of work? He decided to pursue beauty editorial; Finally, a fantastic way to combine his science background along with his intrinsic call to design. A dream career would be working at a publication, testing new beauty products and designing specialized magazine layouts for them.</p>      <p>He is only at the beginning of this journey, but maybe, just maybe, this small town boy will make it.</p>    </p>    </article>  </section>  <footer>    <p>Adam R.
